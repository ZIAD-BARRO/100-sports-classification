# 🏅 100 Sports Classification - Image Recognition with Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning image classification model built to identify sports types from images. It uses a custom dataset containing 100 different sports categories. The goal is to accurately classify images into the correct sport category using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Resized and normalized images.
  - Split into training, validation, and test sets.
  - Applied data augmentation to reduce overfitting.

- **Modeling**:
  - Implemented CNN using **Keras** / **TensorFlow**.
  - Used layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense.
  - Trained using `categorical_crossentropy` loss and `Adam` optimizer.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Achieved high top-1 and top-5 accuracy.
  - Visualized training history and confusion matrix.
  - Performed well despite the complexity of classifying 100 categories.
